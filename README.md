## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Implement the Figma design exactly. All icons, layouts, and cases are provided in the Figma file. There should be no visible difference between a screenshot of the Figma design and the live site.
- Build the site with only what is provided in the Next.js starter project and donâ€™t use any external component or helper libraries. We want to be able to see all your skills at work
- Interpret everything required by the design which includes all interactions, routing, data handling, and error checking.
